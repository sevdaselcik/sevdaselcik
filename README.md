# 👋🏻About

I am a consultant on **information technology, digital transformation, big data, computer science, management information systems, artificial intelligence, research & development** . 

In learning I'm interested in **data modelling**, **knowledge graphs**, **digital art** and being **anti-obsfucatory**, or **against the obscuring of communication**.

I love being a catalyst for learning for both students and clients, helping them to build capacity and enable them to pass on their knowledge to others. I particuarly love thinking about new uses of technolgy as part of a group and then helping to make those uses happen.

Ever since I read the Holly book of Quran I've been interested in the mechanisms or systems that enable stories to be told or society to function. I am interested in making work that express between people, places, stories and objects through the use of technology & art.

I am currently researching & analying the Quran to understand the story of human, to create art & to write strories / books & to design augmented reality sculpture based on .
